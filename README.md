# 🧙‍♂️ RPG Portfolio

Given my love for RPGs, it's not hard to understand why I would want my online portfolio to be themed like an old-school RPG shop cutscene.

## 🌟 Features

### 👑 Animated Shop Cutscene

Your character will enter the shop and approach the shop keeper. The shop keeper will then introduce his wares (which happen to be my portfolio projects).

A long term goal for this project might be to allow the player to exit the event with the shop keeper and talk to other NPCs in the shop.

### 💬 Interactive Dialogue Box

When talking with an NPC, there will be a dialogue box that the user can interact with. The short term vision of this is for the user to click through the dialogue. Perhaps I could implement some user choice, though.

### 💰 Shop Menu

When the shop keeper presents his wares, a menu of my portfolio projects will be listed. Then, the player can select a project to receive a summary and a link to learn more.

## 🚶‍♂️ Movable Player

After the shop cutscene has finished, I would like for the player to be able to move around.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 Interactive NPCs

Eventually, I would like to have other interactive NPCs in the shop that present different aspects of my portfolio.
