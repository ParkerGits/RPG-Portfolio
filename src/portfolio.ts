At the end of the 6 weeks, club members presented functional projects that would make for impressive additions to their resumes. The project that I worked on was this website!

This app randomly selects a student who is enrolled in the course, and allows the professor to score that student's participation. This way, the professor may manage and keep track of total class participation via the app. Eventually, I would like to implement integration with Canvas. Canvas will provide authentication as well as data about the professor's classes and students.",

The encoding process functions by first creating a frequency table that stores the frequency of each character in the message, then by creating a Huffman Tree from the frequency table, then by creating an encoding table from the Huffman tree. I use bitwise operations to convert the binary encoding of each character into an ASCII character before writing it to a file. To decode the message, the Huffman Tree is written to the top of the encoded message, and is read during the decoding process. While I cannot share my code for this lab as it is still being used to assess students at Seattle Pacific University, the grade report I received is included below.',
